This program receives a list of raw audio recordings and distinguishes the 
voice and silent segments in each of them. It then buils an audio clip by 
appending a recording (i.e.\ country_name)  with another one (i.e. capital_name) 
by padding a brief artifical silent segment in between. It repeast this sequence 
once more, appends to other silent segments at the begining and at the end, and 
finally stores the result into an audio clip.
